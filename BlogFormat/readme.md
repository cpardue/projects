Created a python script to quickly format notes as carte-noir blog posts.  

Basically it just asks for user input and generates the necessary header fields, title, and file extension for carte-noir to use as a valid posting format.  It then creates the new titled file, inserts the header, then appends the original file contents into the new file.
