Work in progress.  
Will rename everything once it's working, and begin version control.  

The basic idea is this: 
I need to practice scripting in python.  
I play hackthebox.  
I do the same things over and over for initial recon, it would be nice to write my own basic version of autorecon.  

Script should start with a port sweep.   
Script should then pull open ports and feed them into an aggressive scan.  
Script should then pull open http ports and run directory fuzzers on each open http port.  
From there, idk, I could pull additional ports and run specific nmap scripts against them individually.
