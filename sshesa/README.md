## a tool to ssh into multiple Email Security Appliances

I'm repurposing sshpwn into a tool that I can use for myself.  
Removing all payloads which do not serve a purpose for my usage, and re-tooling it to be a tool which I can use to ssh into appliances and run the same command across all shells, to quickly get the status of specific config settings.
