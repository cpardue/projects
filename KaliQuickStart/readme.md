Idea:  
A script to run on new Kali machines to quickly install and set up some basic personal stuff.  
I assume that it will, within a few years, be outdated beyond reasonable recall.  
List of things to do:  
- redo ssh keys
- edit sshdconfig
- organize /home/
- install git
- install apt-get install maltego metasploit-framework burpsuite wireshark aircrack-ng hydra nmap beef-xss nikto
- add tor repositories
- install tor
...and whatever else, there's more stuff that needs to install such as Firefox over Iceweasel, etc. I'll add more as I periodically think about it. 
It could be that this just needs to be an apt-get install string, and that I should have a separate script for initial setup (sshdconfig, openssl, etc).  
Could be that syncthing is all I really am looking for.
