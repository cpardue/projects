## config_split  

# summary:  
i want a script that splits a config file into easily comparable pieces, as a directory/file structure. 


# progress report:  
not yet started.  


# asks:  
* run in same DIR as config  
* reads through config and generates file structure from config contents  
* file structure mimics web gui layout (mail policies, security features, networking, sys admin)  
* file structure should be VLN/menu_tab_name/sub_menu_name/item_name_trait.txt
