Simple log parser. 
Run it, give it a path/to/file, give it a search term. 
This should be a barebones version of a GUI log parser. 

Requirements: 
* Needs to save path/to/file, maybe option to change from cli window?
* Needs to be able to run multiple searchs. 
* Needs to be able to save results to path/to/results.
